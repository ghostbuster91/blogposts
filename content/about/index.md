Hey, I'm **Kasper** - a software engineer who enjoys writing functional and well-tested code.  
I rely heavily on types, offloading much of the reasoning to the compiler - and occasionally testing its limits.  
Most of the time I write in **Scala**, which strikes that perfect balance between *functional by default* and *unsound when needed*.

Some time ago, I started exploring software beyond what the JVM has to offer.  
This journey began mostly thanks to **Nix**, since it can wrap applications written in arbitrary languages - and sometimes you need to tweak the source to make it work within Nix.  
Have I mentioned I love Nix? The idea of having a single, concise abstraction layer capable of wrapping any program is simply beautiful. 
With **Nix(OS)**, I finally have reproducibility - all the way down to the operating system level.

Most of my work happens in the terminal, powered by **Neovim** and a few well-chosen tools.

I'm not entirely sure how this blog will evolve over time, and I'd rather not define it too early.  
What I do know is that I enjoy "**debugging from the trenches**"-style posts - and that's probably what you'll find here the most.

Apart from code, I appreciate a good cup of filtered coffee - hence the domain name.  
I plan to buy a **Gaggia** espresso machine and mod it with [**Gaggiuino**](https://shop.gaggimate.eu/). 
I'm also a fan of mechanical keyboards; I've built a few myself, and that journey was an absolute blast.

Lastly, a quick note on AI usage:  
I use AI assistance in most of my programming work - mainly for brainstorming and understanding complex concepts.  
The content youâ€™ll find here is **100% human-made**, though I may use AI to correct spelling, grammar or stylistic quirks, so your eyes don't bleed while reading.  
You're welcome.
